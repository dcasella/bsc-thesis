\begin{abstract}

  Recently it has become increasingly important to study character-based phylogeny models that allow for loss of characters.
  For example, tumor phylogeny often involves the loss of previously acquired mutations following the deletion of entire genomic regions.

  The Persistent Phylogeny model solves this by generalizing the concept of Perfect Phylogeny, allowing for each character to be acquired and lost at most once in the evolutionary history.

  The first polynomial time algorithm for reconstructing a Persistent Phylogeny tree starting from a binary matrix was introduced very recently.
  In this thesis we describe the process behind the implementation of said algorithm, using the \cc{} language and Boost libraries.
