\section{Introduction}\label{section:introduction}

\todo[inline]{Expand}

Reconstructing character-based phylogenies, which are used to study the evolution of characters shared by a collection of species (taxa or individuals), \todo{Citation needed} is a recurring problem in Bioinformatics, mainly due to the complexity of the task. In fact, \todo{Citation needed} there exist multiple approaches to evolutionary history reconstruction; \todo{Citation needed} most of those approaches try to reduce the problem by limiting the way (or amount of times) characters can change state in the phylogenetic tree \cite{PPptime1994}. \todo{Citation needed} The Persistent Phylogeny model, which we will talk about in the following sections, allows characters to be acquired and lost at most once in the evolutionary history.

\subsection{Character evolution in Bioinformatics}\label{section:character-evolution}

\todo[inline]{Expand}

To study the state changes of characters in an evolutionary tree we can represent species and their characters as rows and columns of a matrix; each element of the matrix marks the specific state of a character for a species.

We will consider the case in which all characters are binary, making them able to assume only one of two states, 0 or 1. For each species, the state of a character represents if the species has or doesn't have a given feature.

\todo{Citation needed} Binary phylogeny models have already been explored and \dots
\wip[inline]{Continue}

\begin{definition}\label{definition:m}
  \m{} is a $n \times m$ binary matrix over a set $m$ of characters and a set $n$ of species.

  \m[i][j] represents the state of a character \character[j] for a species \species[i].
\end{definition}

A matrix \m{} can then be represented as an undirected bipartite graph. The set of vertices of the graph is $V = S \cup C$, where $S$ is the set of species and $C$ the set of characters.

  \input{figures/figure1}

  \caption{An instance of a character-based phylogeny represented as matrix and graph $(\text{4 species} \times \text{4 characters})$}\label{figure:1}
\end{figure}

In the figure above (\ref{figure:1}) we have a set of species $S = \{ \species[0], \species[1], \species[2], \species[3] \}$ and a set of characters $C = \{ \character[0], \character[1], \character[2], \character[3] \}$.
Each element $\m[i][j] = 1$ of the matrix (\ref{figure:1:a}) is shown as the edge \edge{\species[i]}{\character[j]} in the corresponding graph (\ref{figure:1:b}).

\subsubsection{Character states}\label{section:character-states}

\todo[inline]{Expand}

In a phylogenetic tree, characters can be acquired and lost; we will use the notation \character[][+] for acquired characters and \character[][-] for lost characters. Each \character[][+] and \character[][-] represents a \emph{signed} character.

The Persistent Phylogeny model enables characters to be lost at most once in the evolutionary events; we then need a way to keep track of the characters that were previously acquired. This is solved by introducing the concept of \todo{Citation needed?} \emph{active} characters.

Active characters are a subset of the instance's current set of characters $C = \{ \character[0], \dots, \character[m-1] \}$.
A character becomes active whenever it is gained in the tree.

\subsection{Persistent Phylogeny problem}\label{section:ppp}

\wip[inline]{Expand}

A Persistent Phylogeny can also be called Persistent Perfect Phylogeny (P-PP, or simply put, PPP), since its model is directly related to that of the Perfect Phylogeny.

Each instance of a PPP is associated to a pair \ma{} and a rooted tree $T$, where $T$ is a \emph{persistent phylogeny} for the pair \ma{}. \fix{Reword? Too many repetitions} If \ma{} admits a persistent phylogeny we then say that the matrix $M$ is solved by the tree $T$ \cite{PPPptime2016,PPPcgraph2016}.

We now formalize input and output parameters for the Persistent Phylogeny problem \cite{PPPptime2016}.

\begin{definition}[Persistent Phylogeny problem]\label{definition:ppp}
  \text{}

  \textit{Input:} pair \ma{} where \m{} is a $n \times m$ binary matrix over a set of $m$ characters and a set of $n$ species, and A is a subset of its characters.

  \textit{Output:} tree $T$ solving \m{} if it exists.
\end{definition}

\todo[inline]{Add more?}

\subsubsection{Red-black graph representation}\label{section:grb}

A red-black graph for an instance of PPP is an undirected bipartite graph whose edges are colored as either red or black.

\begin{definition}[Red-black graph for PPP]\label{definition:grb}
  Let $S$ be a set of species vertices, $C$ a set of character vertices, $B$ a set of black edges and $R$ a set of red edges.
  Then \grb{} is defined as follows:

  \[ \grb{} = (S \cup C, B \cup R) \]

  The vertex set $V$ of \grb{} is formally represented as two disjoint and independent sets $S$ and $C$.

  The edge set $E$ of \grb{} is formally represented as two disjoint and independent sets $B$ and $R$.
\end{definition}

The set of characters adjacent to a species \species{} is denoted as $C(\species{})$. Conversely, we use $S(\character{})$ to indicate the set of species adjacent to a character \character{}.

A character \character{} is \emph{inactive} in \grb{} if all of its incident edges are black. Conversely, \character{} is \emph{active} in \grb{} if all of its incident edges are red.

A character \character{} is \emph{universal} in \grb{} if it's inactive and its set $S(\character{})$ is made up of all the species in the connected component that contains \character{}. Moreover, \character{} is \emph{free} in \grb{} if it's active and $S(\character{})$ is made up of all the species in the connected component that contains \character{}.

We say that a red-black graph \grb{} is solved by a tree $T$ if $T$ is a persisteny phylogeny for the graph. Moreover, the construction of a tree $T$ can be expressed as a series of graph operations performed on the red-black graph.
This sequence of operations is called \emph{c-reduction}; a c-reduction is then called \emph{successful c-reduction} if, when applied to a red-black graph that admits a persistent phylogeny, results in an empty graph.

Each graph operation in a c-reduction, represented as a signed character, is called a \emph{realization}.

\begin{definition}[Realization]\label{definition:realization}
  Let \grb{} be a red-black graph and \character{} a character of \grb{}.
  Let $Conn(\character{})$ be the set of species of \grb{} in the connected component that contains \character{}.

  The realization of \character[][+] on \grb{}, which is feasible only if \character{} is inactive, involves adding red edges between \character{} and each species in $Conn(\character{}) \setminus S(\character{})$ and deleting all black edges incident on \character{}.

  The realization of \character[][-] on \grb{}, which is feasible only if \character{} is active and there is no species in $Conn(\character{}) \setminus S(\character{})$ (i.e., \character{} is free), involves deleting all (red) edges incident on \character{}.

  After a realization is performed on \grb{}, all isolated vertices of \grb{} may be deleted.
\end{definition}

The realization of a species \species{} is defined as the realization of each character in $C(\species{})$ in any order.

The notion of c-reduction was first introduced in \cite{PPPbin2012} and is defined as a sequence of positive characters \character[][+]. A c-reduction $R$ is \emph{feasible} for \grb{} if the realization of each signed character in $R$ is feasible for the current state \fix{Reword?} \grb{} is in, and every time a character \character[i] becomes free the realization of \character[i][-] is applied \cite{PPPcgraph2016}.

A c-reduction $\langle \character[0][\pm], \dots, \character[k][\pm] \rangle$ (where $0$ and $k$ represent the indexes of the signed characters in the sequence) applied to \grb{} produces a graph \grb[k], which represents the state of \grb{} after the realization of the characters from \character[0][\pm] to \character[k][\pm].
The realization of \character[0][\pm] on \grb{} produces \grb[0], while for indexes $i > 0$ each \grb[i] is generated from the realization of \character[i][\pm] applied on \grb[i-1].

We provide an example for a c-reduction being applied to a red-black graph in \hyperref[figure:3]{Figure 3}.

\paragraph{Red \boldmath{\sg{}}s}

For a c-reduction to be successful, the graphs \grb[i] induced by the realization of each signed character \character[i][\pm] must not contain a red \sg{}.

We provide some graphical examples of red \sg{}s below.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \input{figures/figure2}

  \caption{Examples of red \sg{}s}\label{figure:2}
\end{figure}

We observe in the figure above (\ref{figure:2:a} and \ref{figure:2:c} in particular) that none of the characters are free in \grb{}, making the realization of any \character[i][-] impossible; then, the graph can't be emptied by a c-reduction.

\begin{definition}[Red \sg{}]\label{definition:sigma-graph}
  Let \grb{} be a red-black graph, \character[0] \character[1] two active characters of \grb{} and \species[0] \species[1] \species[2] three species of \grb{}.

  \grb{} contains a red \sg{} if there exists a (red) path $\species[0], \character[0], \species[1], \character[1], \species[2]$ of length 4, and the edges \edge{\character[0]}{\species[2]} and \edge{\character[1]}{\species[0]} do not exist.
\end{definition}

A c-reduction $R$ is successful if, when applied to a red-black graph \grb{}, the graphs \grb[i] induced by the realization of each signed character \character[i][\pm] of $R$ does not contain a red \sg{}.

A red-black graph consisting of \textit{k} connected components has a successful reduction $R$ if and only if each component has a successful reduction $R_{i}$ (with $1 < i < k$). Then $R$ consists of any concatenation of the \textit{k} sequences $R_{i}$ \cite{PPPptime2016}.
